**Empower Your On-the-Go Connectivity with GL.iNet's Smart Routers**

When you're on the move, whether it's at a hotel, a conference, or a caf√©, connecting your devices to a public, potentially unencrypted, and shared wireless network is often unavoidable. Unfortunately, this exposes you to numerous risks. Hackers may intercept your data traffic, steal your account credentials, access sensitive information, or even implant malware on your devices. To reduce these risks, investing in a travel router is highly advisable.

A travel router not only strengthens security but also enhances privacy and streamlines connectivity for you and your family. With just one click, you can ensure that all your devices connect via a fully encrypted VPN, ensuring a seamless, private, and secure internet experience wherever you go. You can easily toggle the VPN on and off using a conveniently placed external button on the device or through the intuitive mobile app interface.

Furthermore, the router acts as a firewall, blocking many requests to your internal network. Additionally, it functions as a [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation), effectively hiding the internal network and devices from external threats.

Have you ever struggled with weak Wi-Fi signals in your hotel room? This common issue can also be addressed with a travel router, as it can function as a repeater to amplify signal strength, ensuring reliable connectivity throughout your stay.

This article compares two travel routers: the AR300M16, also known as Shadow, and the Spitz 4G router from GL.iNet. Below, we'll focus on the Shadow, which is the smaller of the two routers and ideal for ultra-lightweight traveling. 

The image below illustrates how a travel router can create a barrier between public and private networks on the go, enhance privacy and security with a VPN and [DNS over TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS). To ensure nearly constant connectivity by using the Shadow as a 4G gateway for all your devices, and even enable the use of wired networks if wireless connections are congested.

**Advantages**

* Only the router need to be connected to a new wifi, all your other devices do not need to be re-configured as they always connect to the travel router
* You can tunnel all your communication through a VPN for secure and private internet usage
* You can use a cable based network if the wireless networks are very congested. 
* It is possible to use the router as a gateway to connect to the internet via a cellular 4G network 
* It supports [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) which is a open source trusted router platform for advanced router and gateway functionalities
* The router can be controlled via a dedicated [mobile app](https://www.gl-inet.com/app/) which makes it super easy to setup, monitor and easily do configuration changes.
* You [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) requests also can be encrypted which enhances your privacy
